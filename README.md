## Introduction  

Communication is at the heart of human connection, but not everyone experiences it in the same way. For **deaf individuals**, spoken words can be inaccessible, while those on the **autism spectrum** may find it difficult to interpret the emotions and intentions behind speech. Both challenges create barriers to full participation in conversations and everyday interactions.  

To address this, we developed **Beyond Silence**, a web application designed to **transcribe spoken words into text** while simultaneously performing **emotion recognition**. This dual functionality ensures that:  

- **Deaf users** can follow conversations in real time by reading accurate speech-to-text transcriptions.  
- **Autistic users** gain valuable insights into the **emotional context** of speech, helping them understand not just *what* is being said, but also *how* it is being expressed.  

Built using **state-of-the-art NLP and deep learning models** (Whisper for transcription and a fine-tuned DistilBERT for emotion classification), Beyond Silence aims to make communication more **accessible, inclusive, and empathetic**.
